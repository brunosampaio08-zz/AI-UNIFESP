##Final Artificial Intelligence Course Project

For this project, Kaggle's League of Legends Database was used, available at:
- https://www.kaggle.com/chuckephron/leagueoflegends

The main purpose of the project was to clean the data and then test which ML algorithm would perform better.
The following algorithms were tested:
- K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine Classifier
- Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier

The results showed that the DT outperformed the other methods by about 0.05 accuracy while taking around 30 seconds less to fit and predict.
I am not a pro in Python or ML/AI so feel free to make the code better.
